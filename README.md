prob 1: We are given 2 arrays that represent the arrival and departure time of trains, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required and no train need to wait.

arr[] = 9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00
dep[] = 9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00

sample output: min platform required = 3

prob 2: Find the minnimum number of arrows to burst ballooons. Given a set of balloons each
represented by a range start, end find the minimum number of arrows required to burst all the balloons.
An arrow can burst multiple balloons if they overlap. 

sample input: {{10, 16}, {2, 8}, {1, 6}, {7, 12}}

sample output: min required arrows = 2
